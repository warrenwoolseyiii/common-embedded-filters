# common-embedded-filters
A collection of common DSP filters used in embedded systems, implemented with the option for floating point and fixed point math. Includes a filter designer utility that allows users to generate coefficients for FIR and IIR filters on the fly, and evaluate filter performance before implementing in an embedded system.
# Command Line Implementation
Located in `cmd_line_impl`, a command line program implementing each of the filters in `impl`. This program is used in conjunction with the `filter_designer` tool, but can also be utilized standalone.
## Compiling
Simply use the Makefile to compile the command line program, if you are attempting to compile it standalone, you will need to create several files that are auto generated by the `filter_designer` tool. I recommend doing the following:
```
python3 ./filter_designer/filter_designer.py -e filter_designer/example_configs/fir_bp.cfg
python3 ./filter_designer/filter_designer.py -e filter_designer/example_configs/iir_biquad_bp.cfg
cd cmd_line_impl
make clean
make
```
By running the `filter_designer` tool, you can auto generate the coefficient files and see how they are structured. Then you can modify the files as you please.
## Running
To run the command line tool, simply call the program and pass in an input file to filter and an output file to write the filter data to. Specify the filter and filter subtype.
```
./cmd_line_imple/filter_example -i {input_file} -o {output_file} -f {filter_type} -s {filter_mode}
```
An example call using a provided example dataset:
```
./cmd_line_imple/filter_example -i example_data_sets/low_freq_test.log -o output.log -f fir -s lowpass
```
# Filter Designer
Located in the `filter_designer` directory, the `filter_designer` tool is a python program that leverages the [scipy.signal](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/signal.html) library to generate coefficients for comman FIR, IIR, and IIR Biquad filters. This tool seemlessly integrates into the command line program to test and display the performance of your new filter instantly. 
## How it Works
Provide the `filter_designer` tool with your required parameters (more on this below) and it will auto generate filter coefficients. It will then auto generate coefficient files, compile the command line program, and run it on a synthesized data set with a combination of frequencies in the pass band and in the stop band. You will be provided with a pre and post filtered signal, an FFT on the pre and post filtered signal, and plot of the filter's frequency response. You can choose floating or fixed point implementation of the filter by defining `ENABLE_FLOATING_POINT_MATH` at compile time. See `impl/fixed_point.h` for more information there.
## Using the Filter Designer Tool
The `filter_designer` tool can be passed command line arguments directly, or you can provide a configuration file. Due to the large number of command line combinations, I highly recommend using a configuration file. There are example configuration files for the `filter_designer` tool in `filter_designer/example_configs`, below I will show you some example runs and output generated.

# Implementing in Your Embedded System Project
I highly recommend using the `filter_design` tool to auto generate coefficient files, and coefficients for your filter. However you are free to make your own coefficients and coefficient structures as you like. You can always use the tool to auto generate the files and then replace with your own coefficients.

To choose between floating point and fixed point math, see `impl/fixed_point.h`.

To integrate into your project, simple drop the entire `impl` directory into your project, or reference it from your project directly. To create a filter you will have to initialize a filter object struct, each of which are defined in the filter implementation sub directories. See `cmd_line_impl` for example initializations of the struct objects.

Thats it! Hopefully you find this project useful, please feel free to log any issues, bugs, or feature requests. Or make your desired modifications and open a PR.
