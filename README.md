# common-embedded-filters
A collection of common DSP filters used in embedded systems, implemented with the option for floating point and fixed point math. Includes a filter designer utility that allows users to generate coefficients for FIR and IIR filters on the fly, and evaluate filter performance before implementing in an embedded system.
# Command Line Implementation
Located in `cmd_line_impl`, a command line program implementing each of the filters in `impl`. This program is used in conjunction with the `filter_designer` tool, but can also be utilized standalone.
## Compiling
Simply use the Makefile to compile the command line program, if you are attempting to compile it standalone, you will need to create several files that are auto generated by the `filter_designer` tool. I recommend doing the following:
```
python3 ./filter_designer/filter_designer.py -e filter_designer/example_configs/fir_bp.cfg
python3 ./filter_designer/filter_designer.py -e filter_designer/example_configs/iir_biquad_bp.cfg
cd cmd_line_impl
make clean
make
```
By running the `filter_designer` tool, you can auto generate the coefficient files and see how they are structured. Then you can modify the files as you please.
## Running
To run the command line tool, simply call the program and pass in an input file to filter and an output file to write the filter data to. Specify the filter and filter subtype.
```
./cmd_line_imple/filter_example -i {input_file} -o {output_file} -f {filter_type} -s {filter_mode}
```
An example call using a provided example dataset:
```
./cmd_line_imple/filter_example -i example_data_sets/low_freq_test.log -o output.log -f fir -s lowpass
```
